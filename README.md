# Algorithms and Data Structures
### Description:

To streamline the process of implementing sorting algorithms and data structures, I created a comprehensive repository containing my five most useful sorting algorithms and data structures: binary tree, insertion sort, linked list, quick sort, and selection sort. This repository not only consolidates these essential components in one place but also makes them publicly accessible, allowing other developers to easily integrate and utilize these algorithms in their own projects. By sharing this resource, I aim to promote efficiency and collaboration within the programming community.

### How To Install:
* Simply clone the github repository using any IDE that supports java or just copy and use the code you need

### Usage
* This repository can be used by developers and students as a reference for understanding and implementing fundamental sorting algorithms and data structures in their projects. It can also serve as a teaching tool in educational settings, providing concrete examples to facilitate learning. Additionally, it allows for quick integration of these algorithms into larger applications, saving time and ensuring consistency.
